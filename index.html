      One thing in life that makes me happy is getting knowledge. It feeds me in a way. Don't ask me why.<br />
      That's why I took the course the Complete Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy.
      But however it's fun to get knowledge this way. Giving knowledge is an even better way to get knowledge.<br />
      My motto is giving knowledge = getting knowledge. <br />
      With this motto I try to share acquired knowledge and gather new knowledge to continue growth for organisations, coworkers and myself.

  <h2>Carreer</h2>
  <p class="right">
    <span class="carreer2">
    In 2004 I started at Welzorg Nederland B.V. as an administrative assistant within the site in Roosendaal.
    After various reorganisations, my location moved to Breda and I became an accounting assistant for the West Netherlands region. In addition, I designed some monitor tools such as a purchasing monitor and worked as complaints coordinator.
    Welzorg went through a new major reorganization in 2016 and my position changed into Knowledge Management employee. With which I retained some tasks from my old role.
    We then fully set up the knowledge base into a properly functioning system with various search methods and tools. This knowledge base was used by the entire customer contact center.
    I have held my current position since 2018 and the knowledge base is a secondary task.<br />

    From 2000 to 2003 I worked as a Customer Service Representative at the telecom company T-mobile, previously Ben.
    Within this company I have worked in various departments, including prepaid, postpaid, repairs and collection.<br />
    Look at my <a href="https://nl.linkedin.com/in/marcia-van-den-hout-7376b371" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> profile for more information about my carreer.

    <span class="hobby">
    Like a diverse carreer I have a lot of interests and hobbies.<br />
    Fist of all I love to go swimming in the local pool or join some activities there like aquarobics.<br />
    But I enjoy my time outside too and love to take a walk in nature. Especially when you can find a geocache container there.<br />
    When the weather is fine I love to take my DSLR camera with me.<br />
    After the walk and after editing the pictures I love to write my adventures on social media.<br />
    When it's raining or I'm just in the mood to stay home I enjoy my time behind my keyboard and play with graphics or try to model in Blender 3D.
    <br />
    Of course I can't be creative all the time. In these cases I like to explore things that catch my interest. For example aromatherapy, programming, virtual education etc.
